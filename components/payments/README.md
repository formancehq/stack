# What is it?

Basically, a framework.

A framework to ingest payin and payout coming from different payment providers (PSP).

The framework contains connectors. Each connector is basically a translator for a PSP.
Translator, because the main role of a connector is to translate specific PSP payin/payout formats to a generalized format used at Formance.

Because it is a framework, it is extensible. Please follow the guide below if you want to add your connector.
