                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
                        The regex it matches is (dns1123SubdomainFmt/)?(qualifiedNameFmt)
