helm install postgres oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/postgresql \
  --set auth.username=formance \
  --set auth.password=formance \
  --set auth.database=formance
```

**Create a DatabaseConfiguration object**

```sh
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: formance.com/v1beta1
kind: DatabaseConfiguration
metadata:
  labels:
    formance.com/stack: any
    formance.com/service: any
  name: databaseconfiguration0
spec:
  username: formance
  password: formance
  host: postgres-postgresql.default
  port: 5432
  disableSSLMode: true
EOF
```

**Create a stack**

```sh
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: formance.com/v1beta1
kind: Stack
metadata:
  name: stack0
spec: {}
EOF
```

**Create a ledger**

spec:
  stack: stack0
#  ingress:
#    host: testing.formance.dev
#    scheme: https

```

**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/operatorv2:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified. 
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment. 
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/operatorv2:tag
```

**Run locally without building/pushing image**

```sh
make run
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin 
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
