# formance-operator

This operator is in charge of deploying a full or partial Formance OSS Stack.
It aims to simplify deployment and releases management of different parts of the Formance ecosystem.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against.
Scripts of this repository are using [K3D](https://k3d.io/v5.4.6/). You have to install it.
Also, we use [Garden](https://docs.garden.io/) for management.

### Running on the cluster
1. Create the cluster:

```sh
garden create-cluster
```

2. Deploy:

```sh
garden  deploy
```

This will automatically install all the stack.
When developing, use following command to update the operator code :
```sh
go run main.go --disable-webhooks
```

3. Create a stack

```sh
kubectl apply -f garden/example-v1beta3.yaml
```

Add an entry for `host.k3d.internal` inside /etc/hosts file, pointing to 127.0.0.1.
Go to http://host.k3d.internal.
Login with admin@formance.com / password

### Push to local registry

In order to be able to pull and push the image a registry named `k3d-registry.host.k3d.internal` 
on fixed port `12345` defined in `garden/k3d.yaml` 


Add an entry for `k3d-registry.host.k3d.internal` inside /etc/hosts file, pointing to 127.0.0.1.

Then in order to build and publish your image
    1. `make docker-build`
    2. `make docker-push`
    3. `make helm-local-install`
    4. `make helm-local-upgrade`

### Tests

Run command :
```sh
make test
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out

You can install a full stack using the command:
```sh
kubectl apply -f example.yaml
```
