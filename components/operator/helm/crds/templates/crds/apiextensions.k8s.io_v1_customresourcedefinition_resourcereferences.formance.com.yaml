          ResourceReference is a special resources used to refer to externally created resources.


          It includes k8s service accounts and secrets.


          Why? Because the operator create a namespace by stack, so, a stack does not have access to secrets and service
          accounts created externally.


          A ResourceReference is created by other resource who need to use a specific secret or service account.
          For example, if you want to use a secret for your database connection (see [Database](#database), you will
          create a setting indicating a secret name. You will need to create this secret yourself, and you will put this
          secret inside the namespace you want (`default` maybe).


          The Database reconciler will create a ResourceReference looking like that :
          ```
          apiVersion: formance.com/v1beta1
          kind: ResourceReference
          metadata:
            name: jqkuffjxcezj-qlii-auth-postgres
            ownerReferences:
            - apiVersion: formance.com/v1beta1
              blockOwnerDeletion: true
              controller: true
              kind: Database
              name: jqkuffjxcezj-qlii-auth
              uid: 2cc4b788-3ffb-4e3d-8a30-07ed3941c8d2
          spec:
            gvk:
              group: ""
              kind: Secret
              version: v1
            name: postgres
            stack: jqkuffjxcezj-qlii
          status:
            ...
          ```
          This reconciler behind this ResourceReference will search, in all namespaces, for a secret named "postgres".
          The secret must have a label `formance.com/stack` with the value matching either a specific stack or `any` to target any stack.


          Once the reconciler has found the secret, it will copy it inside the stack namespace, allowing the ResourceReconciler owner to use it.
