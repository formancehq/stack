As mentioned in the previous sections, Formance Wallets is a microservice implemented on top of the Formance Ledger. This implementation exposes some global options that can be configured to suit to better adapt to your needs:

| Environment variable | Description                                                                                                                                           |   |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| DEFAULT_LEDGER       | The identifier of the underlying ledger on which all wallets balances and transactions will be stored                                                 |   |
| ACCOUNTS_PREFIX      | Optional prefix used on all the underlying ledger accounts addresses; mostly useful if you don't want to use a separate ledger for the wallet service |   |
