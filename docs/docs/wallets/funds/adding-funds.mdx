## Funding wallets

To add funds to a wallet, you simply need to issue a credit against the wallet through the `POST /wallets/{walletId}/credit` endpoint. The credit will be issued against the wallet's balance, which will immediately be increased by the amount of the credit.

```json
{
  "amount": {
    "amount": 100,
    "asset": "USD/2"
  },
}
```

### Setting the funding source

When issuing a credit, you can specify the funding source of the credit by setting the `source` property of the credit. The funding source needs to be a reference to a specific ledger account. If not specified, the default `world` account will be used.

```json
{
  "amount": {
    "amount": 100,
    "asset": "USD/2"
  },
  "sources": [
    {
      "type": "account",
      "identifier": "orders:1234"
    }
  ]
}
```
