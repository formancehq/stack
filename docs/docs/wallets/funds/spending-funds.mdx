title: Spending funds from wallets
---

Now that we have a wallet (and some funds in it), we can head straight to the fun part: spending funds from the wallet. In the wallets world, we spend funds by issuing a debit against the wallet through the `POST /wallets/{walletId}/debit` endpoint. The debit will be issued against the wallet's balance, which will immediately be reduced by the amount of the debit.

```json
{
  "amount": {
    "amount": 100,
    "asset": "USD/2"
  },
}
```

### Setting the destination

By default, the debit will be issuing a transaction that recycles funds to the ledger `world` account, which is the default way of representing the outside world and the account being used for sourcing funds when crediting the wallet. However, you can also specify a different destination account simply by setting the `destination` field to any other ledger account address.

```json
{
  "amount": {
    "amount": 100,
    "asset": "USD/2"
  },
  "destination": {
    "type": "account",
    "identifier": "orders:1234"
  }
}
```
