title: Expirable funds
---

There are some cases where you will want the funds that exist in your wallets to expire. This is useful for things like promotional campaigns coupons, gift cards [breakage](https://bam.kalzumeus.com/archive/more-than-you-want-to-know-about-gift-cards/), or any kind of credits with an expiry date that you'll want to be recycled after a certain amount of time.

Implementing such a behavior without the proper underlying primitives can quickly prove itself to be challenging, as it exposes you to a world where your representational state of money has both fungible and non-fungible properties. As a result, complex questions like ... arise.

Fortunately for us, the Formance Wallets service takes care of all of this for you. All you need to do is to specify the expiry date of the funds you add to a wallet, the recycling strategy and all the necessary logic and downstream transactions will be handled automatically.
