title: Creating Wallets
---

Wallets can be created using the `POST /wallets` endpoint, which will return a blank wallet object you can store the reference of in your system:

```json
{
  "id": "e21494fe-dbd1-4323-8f2c-28c3bafb96d1",
  "balances": {},
  "metadata": {}
}
```

:::info
At this point, the wallet will start to exist on the underlying ledger, but it will not have any balances.

## Choosing a Wallet Strategy

There are multiple strategies you can adopt when creating wallets; you can choose to create a wallet for a specific user, or you can create a wallet for a specific resource in your system.

## Using metadata

Wallets carry a `metadata` field that can be used to store any information you want to associate with the wallet. This is useful when you want to e.g. attach a reference to a resource in your system to the wallet.

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "user_id": "1234"
  }
}
```
