# Inviting users

The simplest way to allow users to interact with your Formance stack is to invite them to your organization using fctl:

```shell
# if you have multiple organizations,
# you must specify which one you're using with the --organization flag
# e.g. --organization [OrganizationID]
#
fctl cloud organizations invitations send foo@example.com
```

# Once invited: manage permissions

Once a user has been invited, they will receive an email with a link to accept the invitation.

It's up to you to decide what permissions you want to give to your users. You can do this by assigning them roles.

By default, users are assigned the `GUEST` role, which allows them to read informations from regions and stacks.

You can update roles with the following command:
```
fctl cloud organizations users update <userId> ADMIN 
```



## From the dashboard

You can also invite users to your organization using the organization management feature in the [console](https://console.formance.cloud).

This can be achieved by clicking your username in the top right corner, then clicking on "Organizations", and "Manage Environments".
