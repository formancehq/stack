# Invite users to use your stack

The best way to allow users to interact with your Formance stack is to invite them to your organization, using fctl.

```shell
# if you have multiple organizations, you must specify which one you're using like this :  --organization [OrganizationID]
fctl cloud organizations invitations send [user@mail.com]
```



# Invite users with the web interface

You can also invite users to your organization using the organization management feature in the [web interface](https://console.formance.cloud).
This feature is available by clicking your username in the top right corner, then clicking on "Organizations", and "Manage Environments".
