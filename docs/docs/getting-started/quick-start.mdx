# Quick start

The simplest way to get started with the Formance Platform is to create yourself a sandbox environment on Formance Cloud, using fctl, the Formance CLI for creating and managing Formance deployments. As you'd expect, fctl is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

:::info
The Formance Platform embraces a CloudPrem architecture â€” enabling you to decide how much you want to run on your own infrastructure, and how much you want to run on Formance Cloud. More details can be found in the platform reference [section](/stack/architecture).
