## Deleting your Sandbox

Once you are done playing with your sandbox, you can delete it to free up resources. Accounts have a limitation of one active sandbox at any given time, so make sure to delete the sandboxes you are not using before creating a new one.

```shell
fctl stack delete --name=playground
```
