title: Ledger to Stripe Payout

In this example, we're going to create a workflow that will transfer funds from a ledger account to a Stripe Connect account by leveraging the `send` stage.

:::info
To initiate a transfer from a ledger account to a Stripe Connect account, you must have set the `stripeConnectID` metadata key on the ledger account metadata to identify the Stripe Connect account to initiate the transfer to.

## What's happening in this example?

Before we dive into the workflow definition, let's take a look at what's happening in this example. As you may imagine, when we say "transfer funds from a ledger account to a Stripe Connect account", we don't mean that funds are actually being teleported from our own ledger account to our Stripe Connect account balance. Instead, we'll be doing two things:

1. Recycle the funds we previously introduced in the ledger by transferring them to the `@world` account
2. Transfer the funds from our main Stripe balance to the target Stripe Connect account

<PostingsGraph postings={[
  {
    source: 'payouts:1234',
    destination: 'world',
    asset: 'USD/2',
    amount: 100,
  },
  {
    source: 'stripe main balance',
    destination: 'stripe connect account (acct_xxx)',
    asset: 'USD/2',
    amount: 100,
    shape: 'box',
  },
]} additionnals={[
  {
    from: 'payouts:1234',
    to: 'stripe connect account (acct_xxx)',
    color: 'blue',
  },
]} caption="Ledger transaction (top, rounded) and Stripe Connect transfer (bottom, squared)" />

The Flows service will be taking care of the sequencing for us.

## Prerequisites

Prior to creating and executing this workflow, you'll need to have the following:

* The Stripe connector set up and configured with a write-able API key
* A ledger account provisioned with funds,
* and a `stripeConnectID` metadata key set on it - corresponding to the Stripe Connect account you want to transfer funds to

## Workflow definition

Unceremoniously, here's the workflow definition we'll be using in this example:

```yaml
---
name: "ledger-to-stripe-payout-demo"
stages:
  - send:
      source:
        account:
          id: "payouts:1234"
          ledger: "flows-demo-001"
      destination:
        payment:
          psp: "stripe"
      amount:
        amount: "${amount.amount}"
        asset: "${amount.asset}"
```
