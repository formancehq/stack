### Installation check

You can check that Formance CLI was installed correctly by trying the following command:

```shell
fctl version
```

You should see something like

```
Version | 0.10.1
Date    | 2023-05-11T10:21:28Z
Commit  | f5f577ce
```

If you don't, then recheck the steps above, or [reach out to us](/help) to ask for help.

## Logging In

Finally, you'll need to either log into or create your Formance Cloud account. You can do that from the CLI:

```shell
fctl login
```

This will take you to a page for creating an account or logging in to your existing account.
