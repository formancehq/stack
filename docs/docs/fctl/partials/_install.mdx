Formance CLI is a command-line tool for creating and managing Formance deployments. It will give you access for free to a whole Formance Platform. And, as you'd expect, it's available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Homebrew

<HomebrewStackInstall />

### Binary

<BinaryInstall />

### Debian/Ubuntu

<AptInstall />

### Installation check

You can check that Formance CLI was installed correctly by trying the following command:

```shell
fctl version
```

You should see something like

```
Version | 0.5.1
Date    | 2022-11-14T11:09:43Z
Commit  | 9fe16ac
```

If you don't, then recheck the steps above, or [reach out to us](/help) to ask for help.

## Logging In

Finally, you'll need to either log into or create your Formance Cloud account. You can do that from the CLI:

```shell
fctl login
```

This will take you to a page for creating an account or logging in to your existing account.
