# Formance Flows

Formance Flows is service that equips you to rapidly build end-to-end money flows, without having to spend most of your time worrying about stitching APIs together and dealing with the complexities of the underlying plumbing.

It comes with a novel compatibility model that enables you to move value seamlessly between different ledgers, wallets, and the payments processing world - all while letting Flows translate the meaning of those movements.

It also ships with general workflows capabilities, allowing you to build complex flows that can wait for delay or external events, along with retry and fallback capabilities.

:::caution
Flows is currently in private beta and made available as a technical preview. As a result, its documentation is still a work in progress and, more importantly, the service itself is subject to breaking API changes and glitches.
