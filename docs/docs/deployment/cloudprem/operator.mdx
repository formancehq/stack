import Warning from '../../stack/partials/installation/_complexity_warning.mdx';

Private regions resources deployment are orchestrated by the Formance Kubernetes Operator, which waits for instructions from the Formance Cloud control plane and reconcile them against the cluster current state.

This essentially means that the operator will be creating and maintaining pods, services, and other resources on your cluster for you. It is also the last mile of this setup guide before we get to actually use our private region — let's get started!

## Setup

We can now install the Formance Operator on our cluster using Helm, and bind it to our private region. We will first create a values file, with the following keys:

<!-- agent, operator  -->

* `REGION_ID`
  * The private region identifier, as per given by fctl
* `REGION_SECRET`
  * The private region secret, as per given by fctl
* `REGION_URL`
  * The public base URL you want to assign to your private region
  * Stacks created in this region will be assigned a subdomain in the form of `https://{organisationID}—{stackID}.{REGION_URL}`

:::info
Subdomains of `REGION_URL` will need to be publicly accessible in order to function properly with fctl and the Formance Cloud console.
:::

```yaml
# region.values.yaml
agent:
  agent:
    id: "REGION_ID"
    baseUrl: "REGION_URL"
    authentication:
        clientID: "REGION_ID"
        clientSecret: "REGION_SECRET"
```

With this file in place, we can deploy our private region using Helm:

```bash
helm upgrade --install regions oci://ghcr.io/formancehq/helm/regions \
--version 0.1.1 \
--namespace formance-system \
--create-namespace \
--values region.values.yaml
```

## Custom resource definitions

Two CRDs will be used by the Formance Operator to provision resources in our cluster: the configuration CRD, and the versions CRD.

### Versions CRD

The "Versions" CRD defines the versions that we want to deploy — this allows the operator to provision the created stacks with a fixed set of versions for each stack service.

```yaml
# versions.crd.yml
apiVersion: stack.formance.com/v1beta3
kind: Versions
metadata:
    name: default
spec:
    auth: latest
    control: latest
    gateway: latest
    ledger: latest
    orchestration: latest
    payments: latest
    search: latest
    wallets: latest
    webhooks: latest
```

:::tip
Thanks to this CRD, you can also deploy a custom version of a service, including one you've modified yourself.
:::

Saving the CRD is as simple as running the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f versions.crd.yml
```

### Configuration CRD

The "Configuration" CRD defines the configuration of our application. This includes configuration settings such as listening ports, environment variables, and secrets.

```yaml
# configuration.crd.yaml
apiVersion: stack.formance.com/v1beta3
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: stacks
spec:
  broker:
    nats:
      url: NATS_URL
  ingress:
    annotations:
      traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.entrypoints: web
  light: true
  services:
    auth:
      postgres:
        disableSSLMode: true
        host: POSTGRESQL_HOST
        port: POSTGRESQL_PORT
        username: POSTGRESQL_USERNAME
        password: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD
    control: {}
    ledger:
      postgres:
        disableSSLMode: true
        host: POSTGRESQL_HOST
        port: POSTGRESQL_PORT
        username: POSTGRESQL_USERNAME
        password: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD
    orchestration:
      postgres:
        disableSSLMode: true
        host: POSTGRESQL_HOST
        port: POSTGRESQL_PORT
        username: POSTGRESQL_USERNAME
        password: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD
    payments:
      encryptionKey: DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY
      postgres:
        disableSSLMode: true
        host: POSTGRESQL_HOST
        port: POSTGRESQL_PORT
        username: POSTGRESQL_USERNAME
        password: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD
    search:
      batching:
        count: 50
        period: 1s
      elasticSearch:
        host: ELASTICSEARCH_URL
        pathPrefix: ''
        port: 443
        scheme: https
        tls: {}
    wallets:
      debug: false
      dev: false
    webhooks:
      debug: false
      dev: false
      postgres:
        disableSSLMode: true
        host: POSTGRESQL_HOST
        port: POSTGRESQL_PORT
        username: POSTGRESQL_USERNAME
        password: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD
  temporal:
    address: TEMPORAL_ADDRESS
    namespace: TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE
    tls:
      crt: TEMPORAL_TLS_CERT
      key: TEMPORAL_TLS_KEY
```

Before saving the CRD, make sure to replace the following values with your own:

-   `NATS_URL`: The URL of your NATS instance
-   `POSTGRESQL_HOST`: The host of your PostgreSQL instance
-   `POSTGRESQL_PORT`: The port of your PostgreSQL instance
-   `POSTGRESQL_USERNAME`: The username of your PostgreSQL instance
-   `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD`: The password of your PostgreSQL instance
-   `DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: The encryption key to use for the payments service
-   `ELASTICSEARCH_URL`: The URL of your Elasticsearch instance

And the following values if you want to use Temporal:
-   `TEMPORAL_ADDRESS`: The address of your Temporal instance
-   `TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE`: The namespace of your Temporal instance
-   `TEMPORAL_TLS_CERT`: The TLS certificate of your Temporal instance
-   `TEMPORAL_TLS_KEY`: The TLS key of your Temporal instance

Saving the CRD is then simply done by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f configuration.crd.yml
```


## Liveness check

We now have a private region running on our cluster — let's check that it is active, and that it has successfully bind itself to the Formance Cloud control plane. We can do so by inspecting the region with fctl:

```
fctl cloud regions show REGION_ID
```

If you see an `Active: Yes` line in the region description — congratulations! You have successfully linked your private region to the Formance Cloud control plane, through the Formance operator.

:::tip
You can see the resources involved in this setup by listing everything under the formance-system namespace with `kubectl get all -n formance-system`.
