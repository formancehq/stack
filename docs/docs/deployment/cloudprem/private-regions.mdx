title: Your private region
description: Learn how to setup a private region for Formance CloudPrem deployment
---

Every Formance resource deployed will belong to a stack, itself exising within a specific region. By creating a private region, we will provide a home for stacks that will be deployed on your own infrastructure.

Imagine being able to select `my-datacenter-1` instead of `eu-west-1` on AWS, and creating e.g. an EC2 instance there â€” to be deployed on your own machine, while still being managed by AWS. This is the essence of what private regions are about.

<!-- Beyond the public regions made available on the Formance Cloud,  -->

<!-- Private regions are a way to deploy Formance CloudPrem in your own infrastructure, while still being able to use the Formance Cloud management tools. It is a solution striving to provide the best of both worlds: the flexibility of a self-hosted solution, with the user experience of a managed service. -->

## Creating a region

The simplest way to create your private region is through fctl, issuing the following command:

```bash
fctl cloud regions create my_region
```

This will create a region within your organization, returning a region ID and a region secret in the process. You will need to keep these values at hand for the next steps.

You can verify that the region was created by listing your private regions with the following command:

```bash
fctl cloud regions list
```

And inspect a your newly created region with:

```bash
fctl cloud regions show REGION_ID
```

## Summary

We have now created a private region, which will be used to deploy Formance CloudPrem. Now comes the time to link that region to an actual Kubernetes cluster, using the Formance Operator.
