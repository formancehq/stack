title: Formance CloudPrem
---

Formance CloudPrem is the easiest way to deploy Formance in a standardized way, while still hosting it on your own infrastructure. It relies on the usage of Kubernetes and the Formance Operator to deploy and manage resources in your cluster.

This sections details the specifics of deploying Formance as a CloudPrem Type I deployment, where the control plane is hosted by Formance, and the data plane is hosted in your own Kubernetes cluster.

## Requirements

Before moving on to the installation, make sure you match the following prerequisites:

* You have installed fctl, and authenticated it against your Formance account
* You have a Kubernetes cluster available and ready to be used
* You have a publicly accessible domain name, on which you can create DNS records

<!-- ## Architecture

Formance cloud containers (control plane)
Your private region (data plane)
Your stacks

## Installation

In this section, we'll cover the steps to deploy Formance as a CloudPrem Type I deployment, covering in order:

1. Cluster configuration
2. Private region creation
3. Operator deployment
4. Stack creation

After completing these four steps you'll have your own Formance stack â€” running its data plane in your Kubernetes cluster, in sync with the Formance Cloud control plane. Let's get started!
