import Warning from '../../stack/partials/installation/_complexity_warning.mdx';

In order to streamline feature-complete deployments of Formance Elements, we recommend to use our official Formance Kubernetes operator. The operator source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/formancehq/stack/tree/main/components/operator).

<Warning/>

## Dependencies
Before creating our region and deploying the Formance Operator, let's make sure that our cluster is ready to host our operator and have the required following items below in place.

## Ingress controller

The Formance Operator requires an ingress controller to be present on the cluster. The recommended ingress controller is [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/), which is also the one used by Formance Cloud. SSL will need to be enabled, either on the ingress controller itself or on a load balancer in front of it.

:::info
As the Formance Operator will create standard `Ingress` objects to be picked up, alternative ingress controllers can work just as great but might require additional configuration not covered in this setup guide.
:::

## Certificates management

The operator requires [Cert-Manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/helm/) to run, and to be available on the cluster prior to installing the operator. Make sure to install it now if it's not already set up on your cluster.

:::tip
Default installations of cert-manager should have resources being shown when listed with
`kubectl get all -n cert-manager`
:::

## Stateful dependencies

In order to function properly, stacks deployed within your private region will need the following stateful dependencies.

<!-- * A PostgreSQL instance
* An Elasticsearch or OpenSearch instance
* A Temporal deployment (optional)

The recommended way to spin up these dependencies is to use your cloud provider's managed services. -->

### NATS

<!-- :::info
::: -->

_Version 2.6 or higher with Jetstream is required._

The recommended way to spin up a NATS deployment is through the official NATS helm [chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/nats/nats).

:::info
Depending on your setup, you may need to activate Jetsream mode on your NATS deployment manually. Jetstream is required for the resources deployed by the Formance Operator to function properly.
:::

### PostgreSQL

_Version 14 or higher is required._

<!-- :::info
::: -->

The recommended way to spin up a PostgreSQL deployment is to use your cloud provider's managed services. It is recommended to start with a small instance and scale up as needed, starting with for example a `db.m4.large` sizing on AWS.

### Elasticsearch

_Version 7.10 or higher is required._

<!-- :::info
::: -->

The recommended way to spin up an Elasticsearch / OpenSearch deployment is to use your cloud provider's managed service, or Elastic Cloud itself.

:::info
If using Elastic Cloud, make sure to use a deployment in a network with low latency to your cluster.
:::

### Temporal (optional)

:::info
Using Temporal is only required for stacks using the flows service. It can be ommitted now if you don't plan on using it yet, and added at a later time.
:::

The recommended way to spin up a Temporal deployment is through Temporal Cloud, or by using the official Temporal helm [chart](https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts).

## Summary

Before moving on to the next step, make sure that you have:

- Set up an ingress controller, with SSL enabled
- Installed cert-manager (or had it already installed)
- Deployed the required stateful dependencies

With these steps completed, we can now move on to creating our very own Formance Cloud private region and deploying the Formance Operator.


## Operator deployment

To deploy the Formance operator in your k8s cluster, the first step is to install it. The recommended way of installing the operator is to use Kustomize. However, you can also find a preview Helm template in the repository.

Run the following command to apply the Kubernetes manifest that includes the operator:

```shell
helm upgrade --install regions oci://ghcr.io/formancehq/helm/regions \
--version 0.3.1 \
--namespace formance-system \
--create-namespace \
--set agent.enabled=false
```

This will deploy the operator in your cluster, and allow you to start using it with the CRDs mentioned below.

### Configuration

The Formance operator is a tool that automates the management of specific resources within a Kubernetes cluster. To operate, the operator uses custom resource definitions (CRDs) that define resources specific to our application.

Using these CRDs, the operator can automate many common tasks such as application updates, version management, configuration management and application scaling. This allows developers to let the operator handle the application management tasks in Kubernetes.

In our case, we use three different types of CRDs:

#### Version

The "Version" CRD defines the version of our application that we wish to deploy. This allows the operator to manage different deployments based on their version.

```yaml
apiVersion: stack.formance.com/v1beta3
kind: Versions
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  auth: v0.4.3
  control: v1.7.0
  ledger: v1.10.4
  payments: v0.9.4
  search: v0.7.0
  wallets: v0.4.3
  stargate: v0.1.8
  webhooks: v0.6.6
  gateway: v0.1.7
```
#### Configuration

The "Configuration" CRD defines the configuration of our application. This includes configuration settings such as listening ports, environment variables, and secrets.

```yaml
apiVersion: stack.formance.com/v1beta3
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: stacks
spec:
  broker:
    nats:
      url: NATS_URL

      postgres:
        disableSSLMode: true
        host: POSTGRESQL_HOST
        port: POSTGRESQL_PORT
        username: POSTGRESQL_USERNAME
        password: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD
    control: {}
    ledger:
      postgres:
        disableSSLMode: true
        host: POSTGRESQL_HOST

      postgres:
        disableSSLMode: true
        host: POSTGRESQL_HOST
        port: POSTGRESQL_PORT
        username: POSTGRESQL_USERNAME
        password: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD
    search:
      batching:
        count: 50
        period: 1s
      elasticSearch:
        host: ELASTICSEARCH_URL
        pathPrefix: ''
        port: 443
        scheme: https
        tls: {}
    wallets:
      debug: false
      dev: false
    webhooks:
      debug: false
      dev: false
      postgres:
        disableSSLMode: true
        host: POSTGRESQL_HOST
        port: POSTGRESQL_PORT
        username: POSTGRESQL_USERNAME
        password: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD

    namespace: TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE
    tls:
      crt: TEMPORAL_TLS_CERT
      key: TEMPORAL_TLS_KEY
```

#### Stack

The "Stack" CRD defines the set of resources that make up our application. This includes deployments, services, volumes, and other Kubernetes resources required to run our application.

```yaml
apiVersion: stack.formance.com/v1beta3
kind: Stack
metadata:
  name: stack
spec:
  debug: true
  dev: true
  scheme: http
  host: HOST
  seed: stacks
```
