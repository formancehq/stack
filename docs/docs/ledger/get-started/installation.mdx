# Installation

Interested in trying Formance Ledger out? The simplest way is to create yourself a Cloud Sandbox using the Formance CLI.

Formance CLI is a command-line tool for creating and managing Formance deployments in the cloud. It will give you access for free to a whole Formance Platform in the cloud, including a Formance Ledger service. And, as you'd expect, it's available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

:::tip
Formance Ledger can also be used and installed locally or deployed as a standalone component without bringing the whole Formance Platform to the party. You can find more details about installing it this way the ledger [reference](/ledger/operations/installation).
:::

## Homebrew

<HomebrewStackInstall />

## Binary

<BinaryInstall />

## Debian/Ubuntu

<AptInstall />

<!-- :::info
Consider renaming the executable `numary` (without the `.exe` suffix) to make it easier to type, and so the example commands in the rest of the tutorial will work without having to edit them.
::: -->

## Installation check

You can check that Formance CLI was installed correctly by trying the following command:

```shell
fctl version
```

You should see something like

```
Version | 0.5.1
Date    | 2022-11-14T11:09:43Z
Commit  | 9fe16ac
```

If you don't, then recheck the steps above, or [reach out to us](/help) to ask for help.


## Logging In

Finally, you'll need to either log into or create your Formance Cloud account. You can do that from the CLI:

```shell
fctl login
```

This will take you to a page for creating an account or logging in to your existing account.

## Creating your first stack

Once you're logged in, you are able to create one stack for free, with as many ledgers as you want. You can do that with the following command:

```shell
fctl stack create helloworld
```

This will create a new stack called `helloworld` and set it as the default stack for your account. You can check that it was created successfully by running:

```shell
fctl stack list
```
