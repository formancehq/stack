# Formance Ledger

Formance Ledger is a real-time money tracking microservice that lets you model and record complex financial transactions. It offers atomic, multi-posting transactions and is programmable using Numscript, a dedicated DSL (Domain Specific Language) to model and templatize such transactions.

:::info
We assume here that the ledger service is running as part of the Formance Platform. If you are running it standalone from [source](https://github.com/formancehq/ledger), you will need to adapt the instructions accordingly.
