title: Performance model
---

When building an application on top of Formance Ledger that is set out for scale, it is important to understand the performance characteristics of the ledger.

### Cost of queries

| Request pattern (Ledger v1) | Complexity model |
| --- | --- |
| Transaction commit | O(N) + W |
| Aggregation • balances | O(Log(N)*M) |
| Point query • accounts | O(1) |
| Range query • accounts | O(Log(N)) |
| Point query • transactions | O(1) |
| Range query • transactions | O(Log(N)) |

The complexity model is based on the querying cost and doesn't take into account the networking cost.

### Data volume

In the architecting for scale [section](/ledger/advanced/scale), we outline different strategies to handle a growing volume of ledger data, with a focus on efficient usage of multiple ledgers.

## Benchmarking

Formance Ledger releases are tested against our load testing [suite](https://github.com/formancehq/stack/tree/main/tests/). The suite can be run locally by following the instruction in the repository.
