# Destinations
As with sources, there are several options when it comes to deciding where should the money come from. The send statement provides the following ways of defining destinations:

## Single destination

```numscript
send [COIN 100] (
  source = @world
  destination = @users:001
)
```

## Allocation destinations

Similar to portioned sources, destination can be defined as a sequence of fractions to split the monetary onto multiple accounts.

In any case, the summed total of fractions in a block needs to be equal to 1 and the remaining keyword can be used to reach that total:

```numscript
send [COIN 100] (
  source = @world
  destination = {
    90/100 to @users:001
    remaining to @fees
  }
)
```

Out of convenience, percentage notation is also available:

```numscript
send [COIN 100] (
  source = @world
  destination = {
    90% to @users:001
    remaining to @fees
  }
)
```

## Nested destinations

Finally, as with sources, destination blocks can be nested:

```numscript
send [COIN 100] (
  source = @world
  destination = {
    80% to @users:001
    20% to {
      70% to @platform
      15% to @taxes
      remaining to @charity
    }
  }
)
```
