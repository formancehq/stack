:::caution
This former ledger control dashboard is deprecated in favor of The Formance Platform control dashboard, and will be removed in a future major release. Please refer to the [Formance Platform](/stack/reference/docker) documentation for more information.
:::

Formance Ledger ships with a minimal [dashboard](https://github.com/formancehq/control) that lets you easily see transactions and accounts in your ledgers.

It is conveniently hosted at [control.formance.com](https://control.formance.com/) for easy access, and also integrated into the formance binary, to be started with a simple `numary ui`.
