Formance Ledger can be used either as a standalone microservice, or as part of The Formance Platform. The standalone versions is a good choice if you don't need yet the full Formance offering, and want to keep things simple. The installation instructions below will guide you through the process of installing Formance Ledger in a standalone mode.

Formance Ledger is available as pre-compiled binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows. You can install it using the installers below, or download a release binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/formancehq/ledger/releases).

:::info
For historical reasons, the Formance Ledger packages and binaries are named `numary`. This name will change in the future, though the `numary` command will remain available for backwards compatibility.
