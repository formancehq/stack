To get started in no beat with the Formance Stack, you can use the Formance Cloud Sandbox. The sandbox is a free, fully functional Formance Stack instance that you can use to test and develop your applications. The sandbox is hosted on the cloud and is available to all users.

:::caution
Sandbox environments are not suitable for production use. They are intended for development and testing purposes only. Data persistence is not guaranteed, and data may be lost at any time without prior notice. They also enter a sleep mode after a prolonged period of inactivity, which may result in a longer startup time. If you need a production-ready managed cloud environment, please checkout the [Production Cloud](/cloud/production) section.

## Creating a Sandbox

Prior to creating a sandbox, make sure you have installed the Formance CLI. If you haven't, follow the instructions in the [installation guide](/stack/fctl).

First, let's make sure that you are logged in to Formance Cloud if you haven't already.

```shell
fctl login
```

Now, let's create a sandbox.

```shell
fctl stack create playground
```

Make sure to let the command a few seconds to complete. This will create a sandbox with the name `playground`. You can use any name you want. The sandbox will be created in your account and you will be automatically logged in to it.

You can now check that your sandbox was created successfully by running the following command.

```shell
fctl stack list
fctl stack show --name=playground
```

## Using your Sandbox

Now that you have created a sandbox, you can use it to test and develop your applications. The Formance CLI ships with a number of commands that you can use to interact with your sandbox, let's

```shell
# commit an example transaction to the quickstart ledger,
# increasing the balance of foo by $1.00
fctl ledger send world foo 100 USD/2 --ledger=quickstart

# list transactions in the quickstart ledger
fctl ledger transactions list --ledger=quickstart
```

## Managing your Sandbox

Once you are done playing with your sandbox, you can delete it to free up resources. Accounts have a limitation of 1 active sandbox at any given time, so make sure to delete sandboxes that you are not using.

```shell
fctl stack delete --name=playground
```
