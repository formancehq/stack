## Setting up billing

:::tip
Prior to executing the commands below, make sure you have installed the Formance CLI. If you haven't, follow the instructions in the [installation guide](/stack/fctl).
:::

The first step is to set up your billing account. This will create a new billing account and link it to your Formance account. You will be asked to provide your credit card details in the process, with Stripe being used as the payment processor.

```shell
fctl cloud billing setup
```

Once your billing account is set up, you can manage your plan directly from the billing portal, which can be accessed by running the following command:

```shell
fctl cloud billing portal
```

## Creating a production deployment

Once you have set up a billing account, your quota of available production deployments will be increased. You can then create a production deployment by using the `--production` flag when creating a new stack.

```
fctl stack create my-stack --production
```

:::info
Unless you reached out to us to request a specific region and/or enterprise plan, your production deployment will be created in the `aws-eu-west-1-production` region on the Startup Cloud plan.
