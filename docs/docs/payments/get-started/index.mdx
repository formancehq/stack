Are you building an app that requires interactions with payment providers (like
Stripe or Wise) ? Then you need the Formance Payments service. Formance Payments
is designed to simplify the process of integrating payments providers
functionalities into your app or backend.

Here, we'll help you get started with setting up Formance Payments, adding your
payment providers and creating your first payment.

<!-- a happy graphic here! -->

If you've never used Formance Payments before, then start by [installing the
Formance CLI](installation), and run through the [Connector Installation guide](connectors)
to install your connector.

Then, once the connector is installed, move on to the [basic guides section](basic-guides)

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
