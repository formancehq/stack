title: Transfer Initiation
---

Using the Performance API, you have the ability to conveniently transfer funds
between your accounts or bank accounts on the associated payment service
provider using transfer initiations. This feature allows you to easily manage
your finances and ensure that your funds are where you need them to be.

Currently, our system supports two types of fund transfers. The first type is an
INTERNAL transfer, which allows you to move funds between your accounts within
our platform. This is useful if you have multiple accounts and want to
consolidate your funds or allocate them to different purposes. The second type
is a PAYOUT, which enables you to transfer funds from your internal account to
an external account. This is beneficial if you need to pay external vendors or
suppliers or simply want to withdraw funds to your personal bank account.

A transfer initiation consists of several stages:

- Creation: In this stage, you create a transfer initiation that will be held
in a pending state until it is approved.
- Approval: During this stage, you have the option to change the status of the
transfer initiation to either "APPROVED" or "REJECTED". If the transfer
initiation is approved, it will be executed immediately. On the other hand,
if it is rejected, it will not be executed.
- Execution: In the execution stage, the transfer initiation is carried out,
and the designated payments service provider is contacted to facilitate the
movement of funds between accounts or bank accounts, depending on the type of
transfer initiation.

It is important to follow these stages to ensure a smooth and efficient transfer
process.

## Listing Transfer Initiations

You can list all transfer initiations by using FCTL and the following command:

```shell
fctl payments transfer_initiation list
```

If there are some transfer initiations, you will see the following:

```
ID                                         | CreatedAt            | UpdatedAt            | Description | Source Account ID     | Destination Account ID | ConnectorID   | Type     | Amount | Asset | Status                 | Error
<Formance Internal Transfer Initiation ID> | 2019-05-15T14:00:00Z | 2019-05-15T14:00:00Z | description | <Formance Account ID> | <Formance Account ID>  | <ConnectorID> | TRANSFER | 300    | EUR/2 | WAITING_FOR_VALIDATION |
```

## Viewing a Transfer Initiation details

You can view a transfer initiation details by using FCTL and the following command:

```shell
fctl payments transfer_initiation get <Formance Internal Transfer Initiation ID>
```

If the transfer initiation exists, you will see the following:

```
# Information

```

## Creating a Transfer Initiation

You can create a transfer initiation by using FCTL and the following command:

```shell
fctl payments transfer_initiation create transfer_initiation.json
```

With transfer_initiation.json being:

```json
{
    "reference": "ref1",
    "sourceAccountID": "<Internal Account ID>",
    "destinationAccountID": "<Internal Account ID>" ,
    "description": "description",
    "provider": "ProviderName",
    "connectorID": "<ConnectorID>",
    "type": "TRANSFER",
    "amount": 300,
    "asset": "EUR/2",
    "validated": false
}
```

The transfer initiation request must contain the following fields:

- `reference`: A unique reference for the transfer initiation. This reference is
essential to ensure that the transfer initiation is not duplicated.
- `sourceAccountID`: The ID of the account from which the funds will be taken.
It is crucial to provide the correct ID, which can be found in the account
details. This ID is in the internal formance account format.
- `destinationAccountID`: The ID of the account to which the funds will be sent.
Similar to the `sourceAccountID`, the correct internal formance account ID
should be provided. It can be found in the account details.
- `description`: A description of the transfer initiation. This field allows you
to provide additional information about the purpose or nature of the transfer.
- `provider` or `ConnectorID`: You have to specify either the name of the
payment service provider or the connector ID. If you specify the name of the
payment service provider, the connector ID will be automatically retrieved from
the database, but it will fail with a validation error if you have more than
one connector for this payment service provider.
- `type`: The type of transfer initiation. This field determines whether the
transfer is a "TRANSFER" or a "PAYOUT". If it is a "TRANSFER" type, the funds
will be moved between INTERNAL accounts. Both the source and destination
accounts must be INTERNAL accounts. If it is a "PAYOUT" type, the funds will be
moved from an INTERNAL account to an EXTERNAL account. In this case, the source
account should be an INTERNAL account, and the destination account should be an
EXTERNAL account.
- `amount`: The amount of funds to be transferred. Please specify the exact
amount to ensure accurate and successful transfer.
- `asset`: The asset of the funds to be transferred.
- `validated`: A boolean value. If set to true, the transfer initiation will be
created in a VALIDATED state, indicating that it is ready for execution. If set
to false, the transfer initiation will be in a pending state and will require
approval before it can be executed.

Please ensure that all the required fields are accurately filled out in the
transfer initiation request.

If the transfer initiation is successfully created, you will see the following:

```
SUCCESS  Transfer Initiation created with ID: < Formance Internal Transfer Initiation ID>
```

## Deleting a Transfer Initiation

You can delete a transfer initiation by using FCTL and the following command:

```shell
fctl payments transfer_initiation delete <Formance Internal Transfer Initiation ID>
```

If the transfer initiation is successfully deleted, you will see the following:

```
SUCCESS  Transfer Initiation <Formance Internal Transfer Initiation ID> Deleted!
```

Please take note that it is only possible to delete transfer requests that are
currently in a pending state. This means that transfer requests that have
already been processed or are in any other state cannot be deleted.


## Approving a Transfer Initiation

If the `validated` field is set to false, the transfer initiation will be in a
pending state and will require approval before it can be executed. You can
approve a transfer initiation by using FCTL and the following command:

```shell
go run ./ payments transfer_initiation update_status <Formance Internal Transfer Initiation ID> <Status>
```

With `<Status>` being either `VALIDATED` or `REJECTED`.

If the transfer initiation is successfully approved or rejected, you will see
the following:

```
SUCCESS Update Transfer Initiation status with ID: <Formance Internal Transfer Initiation ID> and status <Status>
```

When you approve the transfer initiation, the payment service provider that is
associated with it is contacted and the TRANSFER or PAYOUT is initiated. This is
an important step in the process as it ensures that the funds are properly
transferred to the intended recipient.

In case there is an error during the creation process, you will receive a direct
notification with the specific error when you approve it. This helps to quickly
identify and resolve any issues that may arise. On the other hand, if there are
no errors, the transfer initiation will be marked as PROCESSING. This means that
the transfer is currently being processed and the payment service provider is
working on completing the transaction. It is important to note that this process
may take some time depending on various factors such as the payment service
provider's internal procedures.

Once the transfer is successfully processed, it will be updated to PROCESSED.
This indicates that the transfer has been completed successfully and the funds
have been successfully transferred to the recipient.

However, there may be cases where the transfer fails to process successfully.
In such cases, the transfer initiation will be marked as FAILED. This means that
the transfer was not successfully completed and further actions may be required
to address the issue. It is important to closely monitor the status of the
transfer initiation to ensure that any issues are promptly addressed and
resolved. Note that if the transfer initiation is in a FAILED state, you will
be able to see the error message that was returned by the payment service
provider by fetching the details of the transfer initiation.

You will be able to retry a FAILED transfer initiation (c.f. below).

## Retrying a Transfer Initiation

If the transfer initiation is in a FAILED state, you can retry it by using FCTL
and the following command:

```shell
fctl payments transfer_initiation retry <Formance Internal Transfer Initiation ID>
```

If the transfer initiation is successfully retried, you will see the following:

```
SUCCESS  Retry Transfer Initiation with ID: <Formance Internal Transfer Initiation ID>
```

Please take note that it is only possible to retry transfer initiation that are
currently in a FAILED state.
