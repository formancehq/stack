## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have a Mangopay account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for a Mangopay account](https://mangopay.com/contact) here. Make sure you have a Mangopay clientID and API key, with the least amount of permissions required to access the functionality of the Mangopay Connector you plan to use.

<ApiWarning/>

## Setup

<StackCmd>

```shell
read "CLIENT_ID"
read "API_KEY"
read "ENDPOINT"
fctl payments connectors install mangopay $CLIENT_ID $API_KEY
```

```shell
STACK="stack_123" \
read "CLIENT_ID" && \
read API_KEY && \
read "ENDPOINT" && \
echo -X POST "https://$STACK.formance.cloud/api/payments/connectors/mangopay" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
-d "{ \
  \"clientID\": \"$CLIENT_ID\",
  \"apiKey\": \"$API_KEY\", \
  \"endpoint\": \"$ENDPOINT\" \
}"
```
