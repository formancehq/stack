## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have a Moneycorp account. If you don't have one, you can [sign up for a Moneycorp account](https://Moneycorp.com/contact) here. Make sure you have a Moneycorp clientID and API key, with the least amount of permissions required to access the functionality of the Moneycorp Connector you plan to use.

```shell
read "CLIENT_ID"
