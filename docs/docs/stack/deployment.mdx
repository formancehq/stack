### Formance Cloud

Formance Cloud is a fully managed deployment of the Formance Platform, which is hosted and managed by Formance. It is the easiest way to get started with the Formance Platform, and is the recommended deployment option for getting started and scaling companies.

This deployment option is available to all companies, as part of the Formance Starter plan.

### CloudPrem (Tier I)

CloudPrem (Tier I) is a hybrid deployment of the Formance Platform, in which the control plane is hosted and managed by Formance, while the data plane is self-hosted. It strives to provide the best of both worlds, by offering an experience close to Cloud in usage, while allowing for greater control over the data plane.

This deployment option is available as part of the Formance Enterprise plan.

### CloudPrem (Tier II)

CloudPrem (Tier II) is fully self-hosted deployment of the Formance Platform, in which both the control plane and the data plane are self-hosted. Its deployment requires a greater level of technical expertise and effort, but provides the highest level of flexibility and control over the platform.

:::info
It is worth mentioning that upgrading from CloudPrem Tier I to CloudPrem Tier II can be done at a later stage if desired, thanks to the separation of the control plane and the data plane.
:::

This deployment option is available as part of the Formance Enterprise plan.

### Formance Elements

Formance Elements is a community edition of the Formance Platform, which can be fully self-hosted. When deployed, it will exist as a headless deployment â€” fully detached from any control plane server. Support for Formance Elements is provided by the community.

:::tip
Components of the data plane are also available as standalone packages. As an example, you can self-host the Formance Ledger as a standalone package, which can live without the rest of the Formance Platform.
