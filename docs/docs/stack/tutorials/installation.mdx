# Installation

Interested in trying Formance Stack out? The simplest way is to create yourself a cloud sandbox using fctl, the Formance CLI for creating and managing Formance deployments in the cloud. And, as you'd expect, it's available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

We also provide Docker images and Helm charts for local and cloud native deployments. You can learn more about all the different ways of installing Formance Stack in the reference [installation page](/stack/reference/docker).

## Homebrew

<HomebrewInstall />

## Binary

<BinaryInstall />

## Debian/Ubuntu

<AptInstall />

## Troubleshooting

You can check that Formance CLI was installed correctly by trying the following command:

```shell
fctl version
```

You should see something like

```
Version | 0.5.1
