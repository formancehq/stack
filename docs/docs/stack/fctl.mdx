The Formance Stack comes with a command line interface (CLI) that allows you to manage your Formance Stack instances. The CLI is called `fctl` and is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

:::info
As of today, fctl is only available for Formance Cloud. If you are using a self-hosted instance of Formance, you will need to use the API directly.
We are working hard to make fctl available for self-hosted instances as well, with a release scheduled for the first half of 2023.

## Installing fctl

### Homebrew

<HomebrewStackInstall />

### Binary

<BinaryInstall />

## Debian/Ubuntu

<AptInstall />

### Post-installation

You can check that Formance CLI was installed correctly by trying the following command:

```shell
fctl version
```

You should see something like

```
Version | 0.5.1
Date    | 2022-11-14T11:09:43Z
Commit  | 9fe16ac
```

If you don't, then recheck the steps above, or [reach out to us](/help) to ask for help.

Now, you'll need to either log into or create your Formance Cloud account. You can do that from the CLI:

```shell
fctl login
```

This will take you to a page for creating an account or logging in to your existing account.

## Troubleshooting

Formance CLI stores its configuration in a file located at `~/.formance/fctl.config` in your home directory. If you are having trouble with the fctl, you can delete this file, and it will be recreated the next time you run `fctl login`.
