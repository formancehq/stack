title: Releases policy
---

This page describes the release policy in place for the Formance Platform and its components. It is to be noted that this policy is subject to change and that the latest version of this document is the one available on this website.

The first thing to have in mind is that the Formance Platform is composed of several components, and as such follows an os versioning model. This means that each component has its own release cycle and that a stack release is made when we have validated that all components work correctly together.

## Components releases

Each component is released under a semver model. This means that each release is identified by a version number composed of three numbers: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

Each component has its own release cycle. This means that a component can be in a different version than another component. For example, the `payments` component can be in version `1.0.0` while the `ledger` component can be in version `2.1.0`.

When a new major stable version is released, it supersedes the former version which enters a maintenance phase. The maintenance phase goes over six months during which:

- Addition of new features will be minimal and not guaranteed
- General and critical fixes will still be ported to the latest minor version of this major
- Security updates will still be ported to the latest minor and some previous patch versions to the extent that it is possible

## Stack releases

## Support policy



<!-- Chaque composant a une release spécifique puis une release de stack est faite quand nous avons validé que l’ensemble des composants fonctionnent correctement ensemble. 
Cette version de Stack est utilisée pour être déployée chez nos différents clients

- Components vs stack releases
- Formance components are released under a semver model
- Stack versions are a set of versions range of specific components
- How long is a release supported
- When a new major stable is released; it supersedes the former version which enters a maintenance phase
- The maintenance phase goes over six months during which
    - Addition of new features will be minimal and not guaranteed
    - General and critical fixes will still be ported to the latest minor version of this major
    - Security updates will still be ported to the latest minor and some previous patch versions to the extent that it is possible
- After the maintenance phase, the version will enter a 6 months sunsetting phase
    - During which only security patches and critical fixes
- After the sunsetting phase, the version will reach EOL unless stated otherwise
- This policy remains subject to feasibility, which will be determined on a case by case basis -->
