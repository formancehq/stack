:::caution
This deployment method is being deprecated in favor of the [operator-based](/stack/reference/operator) deployment. The charts below will continue to be available for the time being, but will not be updated with new features.
:::

To make it easier to deploy Formance Platform components, we provide official Helm charts. To use them, install the Formance repository:

    helm repo add formance https://helm.formance.com
    helm repo update

You can find all the charts in the GitHub repository [formancehq/helm](https://github.com/formancehq/helm).

<Warning/>

## Formance Platform chart

For development purposes and to help you deploy the entire Formance Platform as a whole, we provide a Helm Chart that bundles all the components together.

We however *do not* provide the databases and stateful dependencies in this chart, so you have to provision them as a separate step and properly update the values to point to the correct endpoints.

Values: [Stack README.md](https://github.com/numary/helm/blob/main/charts/stack/README.md)

```shell
helm install stack formance/stack
```
