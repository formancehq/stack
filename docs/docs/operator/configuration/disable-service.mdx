# Disabling a Service

<WIP />

## Introduction
In the Stack object of your Kubernetes cluster, you can disable services you don't want to deploy.
Today, you can disable the following services:
- Ledger
- Payments
- Wallets
- Orchestration
- Webhooks

## How do I disable a service?
To disable a service, you need to edit the `stack.yml` file of your Kubernetes cluster.
By example, if you want to disable a Ledger service, you need to add the following lines in the `stack.yml` file:
```yaml
services:
  ledger:
    disabled: true
```

## Full example

```bash
kubectl edit stack stack1
```
And edit the `stack.yml` file of your Kubernetes cluster.
```yaml
apiVersion: stack.formance.com/v1beta3
kind: Stack
metadata:
  name: stack1
spec:
  debug: false
  dev: false
  scheme: http
  host: example.net
  seed: stacks
  versions: default
  services:
    orchestration:
      disabled: true

```
