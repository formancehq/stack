In the Stack object of your Kubernetes cluster, you can disable services you don't want to deploy.
The following services can be disabled:

- Ledger
- Payments
- Wallets
- Orchestration
- Webhooks

## How do I disable a service?

In order to disable a service, you need to edit the `stack.yml` file of your Kubernetes cluster.
By example, if you want to disable a Ledger service, you need to add the following lines in the `stack.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  ledger:
    disabled: true
```

## Example

Let's first edit the stack object of your Kubernetes cluster

```bash
kubectl edit stack stack1
```

And edit the `stack.yml` file of your Kubernetes cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: stack.formance.com/v1beta3
kind: Stack
metadata:
  name: stack1
spec:
  debug: false
  dev: false
  scheme: http
  host: example.net
  seed: stacks
  versions: default
  services:
    orchestration:
      disabled: true

```
