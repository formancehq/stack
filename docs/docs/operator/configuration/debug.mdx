# Activating the debug mode

It is possible to switch an entire stack to debug mode, in order to obtain additional information on individual components and how they work; which can typically be useful for debugging purposes.


## Setting up debug mode

In order to activate the debug mode, you'll simply need to edit the `stack.yml` file for a given stack, and add the following lines:

```yaml
debug: true
dev: true
```

## Example

```bash
kubectl edit stack stack1
```

And edit file accordingly:

```yaml
apiVersion: stack.formance.com/v1beta3
kind: Stack
metadata:
  name: stack1
spec:
  debug: true
  dev: true
  scheme: http
  host: example.net
  seed: stacks
  versions: default
```
