# Disabling a Stack

<WIP />

## Introduction
In the Stack object of your Kubernetes cluster, you can disable stack you don't want to deploy.

## How do I disable a stack?
To disable a stack, you need to edit the `stack.yml` file of your Kubernetes cluster.
By example, you need to add the following lines in the `stack.yml` file:
```yaml
disabled: true
```

## Full example
```bash
kubectl edit stack stack1
```
And edit the `stack.yml` file of your Kubernetes cluster.
```yaml
apiVersion: stack.formance.com/v1beta3
kind: Stack
metadata:
  name: stack1
spec:
  debug: true
  dev: true
  scheme: http
  host: example.net
  seed: stacks
  versions: default
  disabled: true
```
