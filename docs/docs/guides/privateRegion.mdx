## Create a region with fctl
To create a private region, run the following fctl command:
```bash
fctl cloud regions create name_of_private_region
```

## Deploy region with Helm
You can now create a private region via Helm. To do this, we'll first generate a Helm configuration file.
You'll need to adapt the following values:
- REGION_ID: the identifier of the private region you've just created via FCTL
- REGION_SECRET: the secret of the private region you have just created via FCTL
- URL_OF_PRIVATE_REGION: the url of the private region (eg: https://sandbox.formance.cloud)

```yaml
# values.yaml
agent:
  agent:
    id: "REGION_ID"
    baseUrl: "URL_OF_PRIVATE_REGION"
    authentication:
        clientID: "REGION_ID"
        clientSecret: "REGION_SECRET"
```
We can now create a private region with Helm:
```bash
helm upgrade --install regions oci://ghcr.io/formancehq/helm/regions --version 0.1.0 --namespace formance-system --create-namespace --values values.yaml
```

## Verify that the region is active
You can check that your region is active with the following FCTL command:
```
fctl cloud regions show REGION_ID
```
You now have your own active private region! ðŸŽ‰
