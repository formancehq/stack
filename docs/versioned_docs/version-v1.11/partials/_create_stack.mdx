## Creating your first stack

Once you're logged in, you are able to create one stack for free, with as many ledgers as you want. You can do that with the following command:

```shell
fctl stack create helloworld
```

This will create a new stack called `helloworld` and set it as the default stack for your account. You can check that it was created successfully by running:

```shell
fctl stack list
```
