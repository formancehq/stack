# Inviting users

The simplest way to allow users to interact with your Formance stack is to invite them to your organization using fctl:

```shell
# if you have multiple organizations,
# you must specify which one you're using with the --organization flag
# e.g. --organization [OrganizationID]
#
fctl cloud organizations invitations send foo@example.com
```

## From the dashboard

You can also invite users to your organization using the organization management feature in the [console](https://console.formance.cloud).

This can be achieved by clicking your username in the top right corner, then clicking on "Organizations", and "Manage Environments".
