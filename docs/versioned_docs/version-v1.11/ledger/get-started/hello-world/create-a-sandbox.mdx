title: Create a Ledger Sandbox
---

Formance Ledger is a service that must be running before it can process any transactions. The best way to do this is to create a free sandbox in the Formance Cloud. This way, you let Formance manage the service for you, freeing you up to focus on learning how to use it.

To create a new sandbox called `dunshire`, enter the following into your command line:

```shell
fctl stack create dunshire
```

This initializes a new Ledger, and creates the API and dashboard endpoints that you'll need to interact with the ledger, either programmatically, or manually. You should see something like this in the terminal output:

```
Your dashboard will be reachable on: https://randomstuff-wxyz.sandbox.formance.cloud
You can access your sandbox apis using following urls :
ID			 | wxyz
Name		 | dunshire
Region		 | eu-west-1
Ledger URI	 | https://randomstuff-wxyz.sandbox.formance.cloud/api/ledger
Payments URI | https://randomstuff-wxyz.sandbox.formance.cloud/api/payments
Search URI	 | https://randomstuff-wxyz.sandbox.formance.cloud/api/search
Auth URI	 | https://randomstuff-wxyz.sandbox.formance.cloud/api/auth
```

:::danger Your Unique URI
Notice that when you create a new sandbox, it gets assigned a unique URI, with a domain comprising a sequence of random letters followed by the sandbox ID:

This domain is really important to note down. If you ever forget it, you can always find it again with

```shell
fctl stack show --name dunshire
```

Going forward, whenever you see a URI that looks like
```
https://randomstuff-wxyz.sandbox.formance.cloud
```
substitute the domain for your particular sandbox!

## Troubleshooting

### Too Many Stacks

If you see

```
  ERROR   creating sandbox: VALIDATION: too many stacks
```

then you've created too many sandboxes, and you need to either delete one, or reuse it to continue. You can see all your existing sandboxes with

```shell
fctl stack list
```

which will output something that looks like this:

```
ID   | Name     | Region    | Dashboard
wxyz | dunshire | eu-west-1 | https://randomstuff-wxyz.sandbox.formance.cloud
abcd | dunshire | eu-west-1 | https://randomstuff-abcd.sandbox.formance.cloud
```

If you want to reuse one of the sandboxes, you can get the necessary details by typing

```fctl stack show wxyz```

where you'll replace `wxyz` with the actual ID of the sandbox you want to examine. This command will output all the API endpoints for you to examine.

If you want to delete one of the sandboxes and start over, you can do this with

```shell
fctl stack delete wxyz
```
