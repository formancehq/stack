title: Stack creation
---

We are now reaching the final steps of this setup guide. We will now verify our setup by creating a stack in our Formance Cloud private region.

:::info
The Formance Platform seggregates resources first by region, then by stack. A stack is a deployment of the Formance Platform, isolated from other stacks. This allows you to have multiple deployments of the Formance Platform, for example for different customers or different environments.
:::

## Creating a stack

```bash
fctl stack create foo
```

You will be prompted for the region in which you want to create the stack: you can select the private region we created earlier. As you confirm the command, this sequence of actions will be executed:

* The stack will be registered in the Formance Cloud control plane inventory
* The operator deployed in your cluster will receive the stack creation event
* The operator will create the stack namespace in your cluster
* The operator will deploy the stack in your cluster and all its components

After a few seconds or minutes, fctl will finally return and acknowledge the stack creation and availability.

## Checking our deployment

We should now see some resources in our cluster when filtering by namespace:

```
kubectl get all -n "<YOUR-FORMANCE-CLOUD-ORG-ID>-<YOUR-STACK-ID>"
```

## Using our stack

It is now time to finally use our stack. We will issue a simple command to query the ledger server infos in order to verify that our stack is working properly:

```bash
fctl ledger server-infos --stack="<YOUR-STACK-ID>"
```
