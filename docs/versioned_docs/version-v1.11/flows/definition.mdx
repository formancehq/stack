title: What's a Workflow?
---

Within the Flows service, a _Workflow_ refers to a template that defines an ordered sequence of actions, called _stages_, to be executed as a Workflow _Instance_.

## Workflow Definition Syntax

A workflow definition is a YAML file, with the following structure:

```yaml
---
name: "my-workflow"
stages:
  - send:
    # ...
  - wait_event:
      event: deposit.confirmed
  - delay:
      seconds: 7d
  - send:
    # ...
```

## Available stages

As of today, the following stages are supported:

| Stage      | Description                                                                                                     |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `send`       | Transfers value from a source to a destination. This stage is compatible with ledgers, payments, and wallets. |
| `wait_event` | Makes the workflow instance wait for an event to be emitted by an external system.                            |
| `delay`      | Makes the workflow instance wait for a given amount of time.                                                  |

To learn more about each stage, please refer to the dedicated documentation page in the following section.

## Using variables

Variables can be used in the workflow definition, by using the `${}` syntax. Variables will then be expanded according to the values passed at workflow execution time.

```yaml
---
stages:
  - wait_event:
      event: "${event}"
```

## Lifecycle

Workflows have a lifecycle of their own, and need to be created before they can be executed as instances - follow on to the next section to learn more and create your first workflow.
