## Vulnerability disclosure

If you believe youâ€™ve discovered a potential vulnerability, please let us know by emailing us at security@formance.com. We will acknowledge your email promptly.

Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before disclosing it to the public or a third party. Make a good faith effort to avoid violating privacy, destroying data, or interrupting or degrading the Formance service. Please only interact with accounts you own or for which you have explicit permission from the account holder.

Our full vulnerability disclosure policy is available [here](https://formance.com/security).
