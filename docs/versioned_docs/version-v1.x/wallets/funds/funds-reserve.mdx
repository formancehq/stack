title: Reserved funds
---

In some scenarios, you will want to have a difference between the amount of funds that exist on the wallet and the amount that is available to spend. This is useful for cases where you need to reduce your exposure to third-party risk, such as a merchant on your platform that is not yet fully verified and whose sales may be subject to chargebacks long after the funds have been transferred out of their wallet to their bank account.

Formance Wallets provide a mechanism to easily configure reserved funds on a per-wallet basis.
