title: Send Statement
---

The `send` statement is the main and most powerful stage of the Workflow definition. It allows you to natively send money from a payment to a ledger account, from a ledger account to a wallet and from a wallet to a payment initiation, handling the implementation of the actual underlying semantics.

It can be added to a Workflow definition by creating a new stage with the `send` type:

```yaml
---
stages:
- send:
    source:
      # ...
    destination:
      # ...
    amount:
      amount: 100
      asset: "EUR/2"
```

The `send` statement is composed of three main attributes:

- `source`: the source of the funds to be sent
- `destination`: the destination of the funds to be sent
- `amount`: the amount of funds to be sent

The `source` and `destination` parts can reference either a ledger account, a wallet or a payment.

## Compatibility matrix

| | ↘️ Ledger account | ↘️ Wallet | ↘️ Payment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ↗️ **Ledger account** | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | Partial support **[1]** |
| ↗️ **Wallet** | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | Partial support **[1]** |
| ↗️ **Payment** | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: |

**[1]** The `send` statement can be used with a payment block as the destination, which will initiate a payment to the PSP defined in the `psp` attribute. This is currently supported only for the `stripe` connector, though support for other connectors will be added in the future.

## Source types

### Ledger account

A ledger account can be referenced by providing the `account` attribute, which is composed of the `id` and `ledger` attributes, referencing the account address and the ledger name respectively:

```yaml
---
stages:
- send:
    source:
      account:
        id: "users:42"
        ledger: "flows-demo-001"
    destination:
      # ...
    amount:
      # ...
```

### Wallet

A wallet can be referenced by providing the `wallet` attribute:

```yaml
---
stages:
- send:
    source:
      wallet:
        id: "22d5de50-b5ef-407d-9a03-9e4fc36356f8"
    destination:
      # ...
    amount:
      # ...
```

### Payment

A payment can be referenced by providing the `payment` attribute:

```yaml
---
stages:
- send:
    source:
      payment:
        id: "22d5de50-b5ef-407d-9a03-9e4fc36356f8"
    destination:
      # ...
    amount:
      # ...
```

## Destination types

### Ledger account

A ledger account can be referenced by providing the `account` and `ledger` attributes:

```yaml
---
stages:
- send:
    source:
      # ...
    destination:
      account:
        id: "users:42"
        ledger: "flows-demo-001"
    amount:
      # ...
```

### Wallet

A wallet can be referenced by providing the `wallet` attribute:

```yaml
---
stages:
- send:
    source:
      # ...
    destination:
      wallet:
        id: "22d5de50-b5ef-407d-9a03-9e4fc36356f8"
    amount:
      # ...
```

### Payment

Beyond the syntax, it's important to understand the effective behaviour of defining a payment block as the destination of a `send` statement.

Here, we won't reference a payment by its identifier (as it doesn't exist yet), but rather the connector we want to use to initiate a payment. This is done by providing the `psp` attribute:

```yaml
---
stages:
- send:
    source:
      # ...
    destination:
      payment:
        psp: "stripe"
    amount:
      # ...
```

The `send` statement will create a payment initiation request to the PSP defined in the `psp` attribute. The payment initiation request will be sent to the PSP with the amount and asset defined in the `amount` attribute.
