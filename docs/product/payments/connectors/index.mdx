description: Available payment connectors for the Payments Service
---

The Payment Service provides a connector framework that allows you to integrate with any payment provider. It pre-packages the integration logic for some of the most popular payment providers, as per the table below, with the goal of providing connectivity to as many local and specific payment providers as possible.

You can also create your own custom connectors by implementing the [Connector Framework](/payments/connectors/framework) and taking inspiration from the existing connectors in the Github [repository](https://github.com/formancehq/stack/tree/main/components/payments/internal/app/connectors).
