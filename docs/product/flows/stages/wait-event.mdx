title: Waiting for events
---

Using the `wait_event` stage, you can wait for an event to be submitted to a running workflow instance before continuing. This is useful for workflows that require user input, such as a manual approval of a transaction.

```yaml
---
stages:
- wait_event:
    event: "payout.confirmed"
```

Events can be then submitted to running workflow instances using the `POST /instances/{id}/events` endpoint, or manually using fctl:

```bash
fctl orchestration instances send-event 1234-5678-9012-3456 "payout.confirmed"
```
