# File groups are a mechanism for grouping similar types of files within a project
# using file glob patterns. These groups are then used by tasks to calculate functionality like
# cache computation, affected files since last change, command line arguments, deterministic
# builds, and more.
#
# This setting requires a map, where the key is the file group name, and the value is a list of
# globs. Globs are relative to a project, even though they are defined globally. This enables
# enforcement of organizational patterns across all projects in the workspace.
fileGroups:
  # List of configuration files located within the project root.

# A task is an action that is ran within the context of a project, and wraps
# around an npm or system command. Tasks that are defined here and inherited by all projects
# within the workspace, but can be overridden per project.
#
# This setting requires a map, where the key is a unique name for the task,
# and the value is an object of task parameters.
